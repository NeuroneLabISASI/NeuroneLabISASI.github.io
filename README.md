Fourier ptychographic microscopy probes label free samples from multiple angles
and achieves super resolution phase-contrast imaging according to a synthetic
aperture principle. Thus, it is particularly suitable for high-resolution 
imaging of tissue slides over a wide field of view. Recently, in order to make
the optical setup robust against misalignments-inducedartefacts, numerical 
multi-look has been added to the conventional phase retrieval process, thus 
allowing the elimination of related phase errors but at the cost of a long 
computational time. Here we train a generative adversarial network to emulate
the process of complex amplitude estimation. Once trained, the network can 
accurately reconstruct in real-time Fourier ptychographic images acquired
using a severely misaligned setup. We benchmarked the network by 
reconstructing images of animal neural tissue slides. Above all, we show that
important morphometric information, relevant for diagnosis on neural tissues,
are retrieved using the network output. These are in very good agreement with 
the parameters calculated from the ground-truth, thus speeding up significantly 
the quantitative phase-contrast analysis of tissue samples.

- ### :electron: Neuroblastoma cells classification through learning approaches by direct analysis of digital holograms

The label-free single cell analysis by machine and Deep Learning, in combination
with digital holography in transmission microscope configuration, is becoming a 
powerful framework exploited for phenotyping biological samples. Usually, 
quantitative phase images of cells are retrieved from the reconstructed complex 
diffraction patterns and used as inputs of a deep neural network.
However, the phase retrieval process can be very time consuming and prone to 
errors. Here we address the classification of cells by using learning strategies
with images coming directly from the raw recorded digital holograms, i.e. without
any data processing or refocusing involved. Indeed, in the raw digital hologram 
the entire complex amplitude information of the sample is intrinsically embedded 
in the form of modulated fringes. We develop a training strategy, based on deep 
and feature based machine learning models, in order extract such information 
by skipping the classical reconstruction process for classifying different 
neuroblastoma cells. We provided an experimental validation by using the proposed
strategy to classify two neuroblastoma cell lines.
